# Strategy 1: Policy Issue First
 Instructions for searching and recording policy analyses into the policy analysis registry. This first strategy guides you on how to record a policy analysis starting from a policy issue or debate.


## Main Task  (suggested level of effort in hours)

The main task that you will perform as a URAP in the PPRO track will consist in
carrying out a systematic search for policy analyses. The goal is to build a
record of policy analyses for a wide range of topics, and then explore how their
credibility varies across the main opponents and supporters of the policies
under analysis. This information will be collected in a systematic fashion, and
then recorded in the Policy Analysis Archive.  

Make a copy of the [`template-policy-issue-report.md`](template-policy-issue-report.md) rename it as `01-first-name-policy-issue.md`. Complete this template with the instructions below.

### Step 1: Choose a policy discussion (<2hr)

Based on your own interests, select a policy discussion that you have seen in
the media or that you follow closely. Aim for a discussion that is concrete and
specific. Good examples of a policy discussion must contain an specific
policy, a specific geography or target population, and at least two opposing
interest groups that are (ideally) easy to identify (eg. republicans/democrats, interest group/government, etc.). The policies can be under
discussion at the local (city/municipal), state (regional), country, or even
global level.  

Summarise the policy issue in one sentence, and assigned it into one of the following 11 categories: Environment & Natural Resources; Covid-19; Disaster Relief; Economy & Taxes; Education; Employment & Labor Markets; Housing; Inmigration; Infrastructure and Transportation; Poverty and Inequality; Science and R & D; Health Care; Defense and Veteran issues; Social security and retirement; Criminal Justice.

### Step 2: Identify main groups supporting and opposing the policy under discussion (<1hr)

Identify the two main groups behind each policy proposal, then provide some type of documentation that supports this group's position. Example of documentation could be a newspaper article that references the position of a group, the group or organization's website that declares their position regarding the policy discussion.

If you cannot clearly identify two positions, record "Could not indicate 2 positions" and search for a new policy discussion.  

### Step 3: For the two main groups (one supporting and one opposing): find their respective policy analyses (<2hrs)

Identify the main policy reports cited by each policy group. In the absence of any policy report, identify the main policy estimate cited by each group. A policy estimate is any quantity that is used to support a specific policy position. Note that it is possible for the two main groups to cite the main policy report.

Record any evidence showing that supporters and/or opponents cite this analysis.  Title of the referenced analysis, authoring organization, authors (if any), and URL of the report (if report was obtained via email, posted in this repository and provided link).


### Step 4: Within each policy analysis: read and identify the main benefits and costs (<5hrs)

Identify and record key benefits and costs from policy analysis.



### Structure of the collected information

    +------------+--------------+------------+------------+
    |            |              |            |            |
    |            | Supporting   | Policy     | Benefits 1 |
    |            | Organization | Analysis 1 +------------+
    |            |              |            | Costs 1    |
    | Policy     +--------------+------------+------------+
    | Discussion |              |            | Benefits 2 |
    |            | Opposing     | Policy     +------------+
    |            | Organization | Analysis 2 | Costs 2    |
    |            |              |            |            |
    +------------+--------------+------------+------------+




### Follow up with main groups

Reach out to the main interest groups that you identified above and ask each the following:
- In addition to your organizaiton: what are the main organizations supporting and oppossing this policy?  
- What is the most up to date policy analysis that your organization cites as evidence of the costs and benefits of this policy issue?

### Follow up with authors of policy reports   
Reach out to the authors (or contact information of policy analysis organization) of the analysis cited above (both for supporters and opponents) and ask the following:   
 - To your knowledge, what is the most up-to-date policy analysis on this policy isssue?
 - To your knowledge, what is the policy analysis that is most commonly cited by supporters this policy issue?
 - To your knowledge, what is the policy analysis that is most commonly cited by opponents of this policy issue?
