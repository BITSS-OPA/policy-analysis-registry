## Free College

This policy aims to guarantee the right to a free public education for all American citizens. This means wiping student debt and paying for tuition through a subsidy granted by the "Robinhood Tax", or through a financial transaction tax. The main opposers of this policy argue that this tax will be an added sales tax for retirees and the business industry.

## Policy estimates


### Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:**
https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/

**Title of report:** The Revenue Potential of a Financial Transaction Tax for U.S. Financial Markets

**Authoring Organization:** Political Economy Research Institute (PERI)

**Authors (if any):** Robert Pollin, James Heintz, and Thomas Herndon

**URL of report:**
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02692171.2018.1485634

#### Main Benefits
- The tax would fully subsidize the "Free College" plan for free tuition and wiping student debt (FTT would generate about $250 bn per year)

#### Main Costs
- The Inclusive Prosperity act would result in:
  - A tax credit provision that would result in foregone revenue of $20 bn
  - A net change in tax revenues would result in foregone revenue of $10 bn

This brings the estimated revenue of this policy to $220 bn = 1.2% of GDP


### Presented by opposing group
**Evidence of opponents citing this report:**
https://thehill.com/policy/finance/461579-chamber-of-commerce-argues-against-financial-transaction-taxes

**Title of report:** Financial Transaction Taxes: A tax on investors, taxpayers, and consumers

**Authoring Organization:** Center for Capital Markets

**Authors (if any):** James J. Angel

**URL of report:** https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CCMC_FTT-Report_v2-DIGITAL.pdf

#### Main Benefits
- FTT will drive up cost of trading by more than amount of tax ($100 stock would cost 50$ directly and more indirectly, a tenfold increase)
- Retirement savings will stay put if FTT isn't enacted (Retirement investors will end up with 8.5% less in 401ks, or $20,000 on average)

#### Main Costs
- No costs assessed *I guess the fact that there is no proposed replacement for FFT is in place, and in return, no feasibility of free college, but I'm not sure if that's appropriate
