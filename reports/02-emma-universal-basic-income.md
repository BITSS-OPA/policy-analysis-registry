## Policy estimates

### Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:** A central part of Yang's 2020 presidential campaign was the "Freedom Dividend," a $1000 monthly UBI payment. https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/  

**Title of report:** Modeling the Macroeconomic Effects of a Universal Basic Income

**Authoring Organization:** Roosevelt Institute

**Authors (if any):** Michalis Nikiforos, Marshall Steinbaum, Gennaro Zezza

**URL of report:** https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RI-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-UBI-201708.pdf  

The Roosevelt Institute study considers 3 alternative proposals of a UBI policy, and constructs different scenarios to consider financing options and distributional effects. For this policy analysis report, the relevant scenarios are scenarios 2 and 8, which examine a fully deficit-financed $500 monthly allowance for all adults. Scenario 8 adjusts Scenario 2 results for distributional effects.

#### Main Benefits
- relevant scenarios project a 6.5% increase (scenario 2) and 6.79% increase (scenario 8), respectively, in Real GDP
  - Figure 2b: Scenarios 2 and 8 result in ~1.2-1.3 billion increase over 2009 GDP
- 2.389 billion jobs added under scenario 2, 2.502 billion jobs added under scenario 8

#### Main Costs
- (For same scenarios 2 and 8) 4.73% increase and 4.61% increase in deficit

The Penn-Wharton Budget Model also assumes the UBI policy is deficit-funded.  For a $6000 annual allowance:  

#### Main Benefits
- No specific quantitative benefits specified

#### Main Costs
- If plan is implemented in 2018, there is an expected reduction in GDP of 6.1% by 2027, and 9.3% by 2032.
- Increase federal debt by more than 63.5% by 2027 and 81.1% by 2032
