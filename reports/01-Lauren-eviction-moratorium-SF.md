## Temporary Moratoriums on Residential Evictions in San Francisco due to COVID-19.

The COVID-19 Tenant Protections Ordinance amendments provide that no tenant may be evicted for non-payment of rent while the Governor's Executive Order on evictions is in effect (currently March 16, 2020 through September 30, 2020, unless extended), *even* if the rent is not paid after the Mayorâ€™s Temporary Eviction Moratorium period expires.

- This ordinance prevents landlords from __*ever*__ exercising action for nonpayment even long after the COVID period ends, 97% of tenants have paid on time and thus this extension of the moratorium deemed unnecessary and harmful.
