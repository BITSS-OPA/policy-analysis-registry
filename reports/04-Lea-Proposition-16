  - Taking action to prevent discrimination and ensure equal opportunity for all
  - Rebuilding an economy that treats everyone equally

#### Main Costs
- Fiscal analysis by CA Legislative Analyst:

  - "No Direct Fiscal Effects on Public Entities."
    - The measure would have no direct fiscal effect on state and local entities because the measure would not require any change to current policies or programs. Instead, any fiscal effects would depend on future choices by state and local entities to implement policies or programs that consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, public employment, and public contracting.
  - "Potential Fiscal Effects of Implementing Programs Highly Uncertain."
    - State and local entities could make any number of decisions about policies and programs that consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. Because the specific choices state and local entities would make if voters approved this measure are unknown, the potential fiscal effects are highly uncertain.
