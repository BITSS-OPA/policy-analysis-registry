### Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:** https://yeson21ca.org/get-the-facts/#research

**Title of report:** Opening the Door for Rent Control: Toward a Comprehensive Approach to Protecting California's Renters  

**Authoring Organization:** Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society at UC Berkeley

**Authors (if any):** Nicole Montojo, Stephen Barton, Eli Moore

**URL of report:** https://belonging.berkeley.edu/opening-door-rent-control

#### Main Benefits
- Housing stability for existing tenants (Increased tenants probability of staying by 20%; without rent control, those tenants would leave the city)
- Improved affordability:
    - After living in rent-stabilized homes for 3-5 years, tenants’ rents were between 26.5-30.9% lower than market rent, and for those with tenure between 5-10 years, this discount was as high as 36.8%
    - Benefits to tenants averaged between $2300-$6600 per person each year, with aggregate benefits totaling over $214 million annually.
- Preservation of economic diversity (A study of the effects of lifting rent control in Cambridge, Massachusetts found that after the policy’s repeal, the value of formerly stabilized properties increased by 18-25% in 10 years, and the value of non-controlled units increased by 12 percent)

#### Main Costs
- New market rates will not filter down to moderate/low-income tenants (A shortfall of 1.5 million tenants)
- While construction market rates fall by 1.5%, rent only drops by 0.3% annually, leading to a heightened housing cost burden
