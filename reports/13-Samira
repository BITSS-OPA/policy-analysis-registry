The housing choice voucher program (section 8)  is the largest US housing program funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that provides rent subsidy to low-income families. Proponents argue that section 8 should be funded more by the government while opponents argue that this program is flawed, keeps people in poverty, and fails to attract private housing providers.

#### Main Benefits
- The program is underfunded.  and only one out of four households eligible for rent assistance receive it. Only 37 affordable and available homes exist for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. With efficient funding, over time 17 million low-income families will access assistance.

- Seventy-one percent (7.8 million) of the nation’s 11 million extremely low-income renter households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their incomes on rent and utilities. Section 8 benefits can alleviate this pressure on low-income households.  

#### Main Costs
-Biden will invest $640 billion over ten years by raising taxes on corporations and large financial institutions. Specifically, approximately $300 billion of the housing plan is devoted to new construction and is encompassed in the $3.1 trillion infrastructure plan. The remaining portion is paid by instituting a financial fee on certain liabilities of firms with over $50 billion in assets.

#### Main Benefits
- The Project-Based Rental Assistance programs provide homes for nearly 1.3 million families and elderly households in privately owned housing.

#### Main Costs
 

- On average, there is a 10% reduction in earnings for people in the years immediately after receiving the vouchers.
- Section 8 voucher recipients often relocate when they first receive a voucher. Although this relocation may be beneficial in the long-term, it likely disrupts social and labor market networks in the short-term.

-HUD estimates that the United States has 10 to 12 million total [rental housing providers] and only a fraction of them participate in the HCV program. Between 2009 and 2016, the number of unique [owners and operators] participating in the HCV program declined from 775,000 to 695,000. 
-Additional regulatory requirements and inspections for disincentives private housing suppliers.
