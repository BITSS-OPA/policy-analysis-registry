## Policy estimates


## Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:**
Mentions IPCC report.
https://www.climatedocket.com/2019/03/13/carbon-capture-fossil-fuels-ciel-report/

**Title of report:**
Global Warming of 1.5C, Section 2.4 "Disentangling the Whole System Transformation," subsection 2.4.2.3 "Deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage."

**Authoring Organization:**
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

**Authors (if any):**
Rogelj, J., D. Shindell, K. Jiang, S. Fifita, P. Forster, V. Ginzburg, C. Handa, H. Kheshgi, S. Kobayashi, E. Kriegler, L. Mundaca, R. Séférian, and M.V. Vilariño, 2018

**URL of report:**
https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-2/

### Main Benefits
- Potential to capture and store 2,000 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050, worldwide.

### Main Costs

*IPCC report contained no mention of monetary costs (too broad on global scale), but found U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) document*:
https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/10/f67/Internal%20Revenue%20Code%20Tax%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf

##### Overall:
- Monetary: (for the United States)
 - **45Q tax credit** (for businesses producing C02)
  - $50 per metric ton stored geologically
  - $35 for EOR, EGR, or CO2 utilized in another qualified manner, with the credit increasing annually until the full value is reached in 2026.
- Not fully-proven technology
- Risks of further environmental damage in storage process (leakage)
- Vulnerable communities negatively affected

#### Main Benefits

- In the race to mitigate the effects of climate change and keep global warming to the maximum increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, any technology, such as Carbon-Capture technology that limits or reduces the amount of Carbon Dioxide in earth's atmosphere is helpful; what matters is who is funding it, supporting it, and why.

#### Main Costs
- Monetary costs not mentioned in report.
- Cost to environment from: Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
  - Most large-scale CCS projects use captured carbon

for *Enhanced Oil Recovery*; proponents of carbon capture and storage estimate that its use for Enhanced Oil Recovery could spur consumption of *40% more coal and up to 923 million additional barrels of oil in the US alone by 2040*, and *most current or anticipated commercial applications of direct air capture are for the production of liquid (transport) fuels or enhanced oil recovery* hence negating and worsening any attempt at mitigating carbon emissions (as it is sometimes advertised).
 - Calculation of cost of Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide in atmosphere SOLELY because of CCUS technology in the United States alone:
   - According to the EPA's "Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator":

   - 5.80 mmbtu/barrel × 20.31 kg C/mmbtu × 44 kg CO2/12 kg C × 1 metric ton/1,000 kg = 0.43 metric tons CO2/barrel

   - "923 million additional barrels of oil" in US alone (CIEL) = 923,000,000 [barrels] x 0.43 [tons of CO2/barrel]

   = 396890000 (~ 396 million) more tons of C02 emitted by 2040 in the US alone

   ###### = 0.39689 Gigatons C02 added by 2040 in US alone.  396 million/20 years = approximately 20 million tons of additional C02 added by the United States to the atmosphere per year SOLELY due to the utilization of Carbon-Capture technology for Enhanced Oil Recovery in otherwise depleted oil wells. 


- Leading proponents of direct air capture explicitly
market the process as a way to preserve existing energy and transportation systems.
- Direct air capture requires large energy inputs, resulting in either associated emissions or the diversion
of renewable resources that would otherwise displace
fossil fuels.
- Despite the industry’s extensive research into carbon storage, as well as research from institutions such as the International Energy Agency, underground carbon dioxide storage has not been demonstrated to work at the scale needed for the global deployment of CCS some advocates support.
