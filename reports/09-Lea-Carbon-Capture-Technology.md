## Policy Debate: Government-Subsidizing of Carbon Capture Technology

Should governments around the world subsidize the production of carbon-capture technology – what some believe to be a crucial element in mitigating climate change – or (based on evidence about said technology) should climate-mitigation government funds be directed elsewhere?

"Most energy experts, including officials at the International Energy Agency, say that the technology is needed to slow climate change because it can significantly reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels, which they predict will remain a large portion of the global energy mix through 2050. Many environmentalists, on the other hand, say that C.C.S. is a costly half-measure that delays the transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar."

    - "All major oil companies have invested in negative emissions technologies. Currently, there are 23 large-scale CCUS projects around the world that are either operating or under construction."
    - Oil companies get tax breaks when they invest in fossil fuel storage, likely benefit and profit financially due to investments in capture-tech stationed at their current stations, let alone the potential revenue from Enhanced Oil Recovery propped up by CCS.
      - "The federal government also provides tax credits to fossil fuel companies that incorporate CO2 capture and storage systems in their operations."


### Opposing group
Name: Other environmental groups, such as *Greenpeace*,*Sunrise Movement*, *National Resources Defense Council*, *Center for International Environmental Law (published paper warning of possible slow-down of transition to renewables)*, some members of congress, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

## Policy estimates


## Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:**
"Governments and private investors have begun to hail those technologies as a viable path toward slowing global warming and a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mentions them as necessary to meet the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement. They have drawn significant investment from oil, gas and coal companies looking for ways to continue developing fossil fuels as the world moves toward cleaner energy."
https://www.climatedocket.com/2019/03/13/carbon-capture-fossil-fuels-ciel-report/
- Caveat: so much of the funding into Carbon-Capture technology research is brought by fossil fuel CEOs and investors, seemingly only interested in preserving the fossil fuel industry, not mitigating the effects that their products have had on the environment at large.

### Main Benefits
###### - potential for capturing and storing 2,000 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050.
- "The quantity of CO2 stored via CCS over this century in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot ranges from zero to more than 1,200 GtCO2, (Figure 2.17). The IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) found that that, worldwide, it is likely that there is a technical potential of at least about 2,000 GtCO2."
- found in IPCC report in Section 2.4 "Disentangling the Whole System Transformation" --> under subsection 2.4.2.3 "Deployment of carbon capture and storage," found here: https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-2/


### Main Costs
##### Overall:
- Drawbacks are not actually presented by those supporting the production of these technologies, but potential risks and costs are discussed in the IPCC report at length
- Though well-funded and "hot" in the market for sustainable development, these methods are not proven effective on a massive scale;
-   
###### If poorly implemented, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options such as bioenergy, BECCS and AFOLU would lead to trade- offs. Appropriate design and implementation requires considering local people’s needs, biodiversity and other sustainable development dimensions (very high confidence). {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3}"
- "The impacts of carbon dioxide removal options on SDGs depend on the type of options and the scale of deployment (high confidence).

-  5.4.1.1: "However, possible trade-offs due to risks of CCS-based carbon leakage, increased electricity demands, and associated price impacts affecting energy access and poverty (SDGs 7 and 1) would need careful regulatory attention (Wesseling et al., 2017)"
- "The use of fossil CCS, which plays an important role in deep mitigation pathways (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2.3), implies continued adverse impacts of upstream supply-chain activities in the coal sector, and because of lower efficiency of CCS coal power plants (SDG 12), upstream impacts and local air pollution are likely to be exacerbated (SDG 3). Furthermore, there is a non-negligible risk of carbon dioxide leakage from geological storage and the carbon dioxide transport infrastructure (SDG 3) (Table 5.2)."
  - Emerging evidence indicates that future mitigation efforts that would be required to reach stringent climate targets, particularly those associated with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) (e.g., afforestation and reforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; BECCS), may also impose significant constraints upon poor and vulnerable communities (SDG 1) via increased food prices and competition for arable land, land appropriation and dispossession (Cavanagh and Benjaminsen, 2014; Hunsberger et al., 2014; Work, 2015; Muratori et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Burns and Nicholson, 2017; Corbera et al., 2017)222 with disproportionate negative impacts upon rural poor and indigenous populations (SDG 1) (robust evidence, high agreement) (Section 5.4.2.2, Table 5.2, Figure 5.2) (Grubert et al., 2014; Grill et al., 2015; Zhang and Chen, 2015; Fricko et al., 2016; Johansson et al., 2016; Aha and Ayitey, 2017; De Stefano et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017)223. Crops for bioenergy may increase irrigation needs and exacerbate water stress with negative associated impacts on SDGs 6 and 10 (Boysen et al., 2017)224.

#### Main Benefits

- In the race to mitigate the effects of climate change and keep global warming to the maximum increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, any technology, such as Carbon-Capture technology that limits or reduces the amount of Carbon Dioxide in earth's atmosphere is helpful; what matters is who is funding it, supporting it, and why.

#### Main Costs

- ###### Enhanced Oil Recovery
  - Most large-scale CCS projects use captured carbon
for *Enhanced Oil Recovery*; proponents of carbon capture and storage estimate that its use for Enhanced Oil Recovery could spur consumption of *40% more coal and up to 923 million additional barrels of oil in the US alone by 2040*, and *most current or anticipated commercial applications of direct air capture are for the production of liquid (transport) fuels or enhanced oil recovery* hence negating and worsening any attempt at mitigating carbon emissions (as it is sometimes advertised).
 - Calculation of cost of Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide in atmosphere SOLELY because of CCUS technology in the United States alone:
   - According to the EPA's "Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator":

   - 5.80 mmbtu/barrel × 20.31 kg C/mmbtu × 44 kg CO2/12 kg C × 1 metric ton/1,000 kg = 0.43 metric tons CO2/barrel

   - "923 million additional barrels of oil" in US alone (CIEL) = 923,000,000 [barrels] x 0.43 [tons of CO2/barrel]

   = 396890000 (~ 396 million) more tons of C02 emitted by 2040 in the US alone

   ###### = 0.39689 Gigatons C02 added by 2040 in US alone.  396 million/20 years = approximately 20 million tons of additional C02 added by the United States to the atmosphere per year SOLELY due to the utilization of Carbon-Capture technology for Enhanced Oil Recovery in otherwise depleted oil wells. 


- Leading proponents of direct air capture explicitly
market the process as a way to preserve existing energy and transportation systems.
- Direct air capture requires large energy inputs, resulting in either associated emissions or the diversion
of renewable resources that would otherwise displace
fossil fuels.
- Despite the industry’s extensive research into carbon storage, as well as research from institutions such as the International Energy Agency, underground carbon dioxide storage has not been demonstrated to work at the scale needed for the global deployment of CCS some advocates support.
