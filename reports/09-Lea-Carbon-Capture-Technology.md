## Policy Debate: Government-Subsidizing of Carbon Capture Technology

The potential environmental and economic impacts of carbon-capture technology is debated amongst academics and environmental organizations, which informs policy decisions whether or not to subsidize the construction of these projects.

## Policy estimates


### Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:**
"Governments and private investors have begun to hail those technologies as a viable path toward slowing global warming and a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mentions them as necessary to meet the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement. They have drawn significant investment from oil, gas and coal companies looking for ways to continue developing fossil fuels as the world moves toward cleaner energy."

- Caveat: so much of the funding into Carbon-Capture technology research is brought by fossil fuel CEOs and investors, seemingly only interested in preserving the fossil fuel industry, not mitigating the effects that their products have had on the environment at large.

#### Main Benefits
- The quantity of CO2 stored via CCS over this century in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot ranges from zero to more than 1,200 GtCO2, (Figure 2.17). The IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) found that that, worldwide, it is likely that there is a technical potential of at least about 2,000 GtCO2

#### Main Costs
- The research and confidence in these methods both scientifically and economically are highly disputed and expensive, hence will not move forward in policy discussions efficiently.


### Presented by opposing group
**Evidence of opponents citing this report:**
"A recently published study by the Center for International Environmental Law warned that some technologies, in particular carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, could slow the transition to renewables."

FUEL TO THE FIRE: How Geoengineering Threatens to Entrench
Fossil Fuels and Accelerate the Climate Crisis

#### Main Benefits

- In the race to mitigate the effects of climate change and keep global warming to the maximum increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, any technology, such as Carbon-Capture technology that limits or reduces the amount of Carbon Dioxide in earth's atmosphere is helpful; what matters is who is funding it, supporting it, and why.

#### Main Costs
- Most large-scale CCS projects use captured carbon
for enhanced *oil recovery*; proponents of carbon capture and storage estimate that its use for EOR could spur consumption of *40% more coal and up to 923 million additional barrels of oil in the US alone by 2040*, and *most current or anticipated commercial applications of direct air capture are for the production of liquid (transport) fuels or enhanced oil recovery* hence negating and worsening any attempt at mitigating carbon emissions (as it is sometimes advertised).
- Leading proponents of direct air capture explicitly
market the process as a way to preserve existing energy and transportation systems.
- Direct air capture requires large energy inputs, resulting in either associated emissions or the diversion
of renewable resources that would otherwise displace
fossil fuels.
