**Authoring Organization:** Legislative Analyst Office

#### Main Benefits
- Schools and local governments would receive an increase in revenue by 200,000 to 400,000 per year* for the first few years, overtime increasing to about 1 billion dollars per year as a result of reevaluation of 60,000 to 80,000 households estimated excluded households due to inheritance property tax laws.
- The number of movers could increase by 10,000 to 60,000** increasing property tax revenue due to higher home prices and increased demand for home building.


*assumed from LAO report which mentions "a couple hundred million dollars per year"

** assumed from LAO report which mentions "tens of thousands of movers"  


*NOTE*: the addition of funding for fire protection was added to the proposition after this report was made.

#### Main Costs
- Eligible homeowners would pay their previous property tax when moving to a new home (applies to up to three moves) which would decrease property taxes and thus, decrease funding for schools and local governments by 10 to 70 million dollars*** in the first few years and hundreds of millions of dollars in future years.
- County administration costs for property tax is likely to  increase by 10 to 70 millions dollars per year****.
