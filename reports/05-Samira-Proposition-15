#### Main Benefits
- An estimated 92% of the revenue raised would come from 10.5% of all commercial and industrial properties in the state. This means that this propositions targets highly valuable properties that haven't been assessed for decades. 
- On average, the properties that would be reassessed under Prop. 15 are currently under- assessed by 50% or more – meaning that the market value of an average property subject to reassessment is at least twice the assessed value. Vast Majority of Proposition 15 Revenue Would Come From a Small Share of High-Value Properties
- Home-based businesses and other limited commercial uses of residential property would not be subject to reassessment to market value. This would exempt about 54% of the state’s small businesses – including about 56% of minority-owned small businesses.
- All properties that are worth $3 million or less and have owners with no more than $3 million in statewide commercial and industrial property would be exempt from the new system of assessment based on market value. It is estimated that 30% of the state’s small businesses own or rent property qualifying for this exemption.This means that the majority of small businesses would not be affected by the measure’s reassessment provisions but would benefit from the new personal property tax exemptions.
- Local governments would gain new revenues from Prop. 15, with cities, counties, and special districts gaining roughly $4 billion to $7 billion in new property taxes each year.

#### Main Costs
- increase the tax on industrial property owners by $6.5 to $11.5 billion.

#### Main Benefits
-increase property tax revenue by 6.5 to 11.5 billion. 

#### Main Costs
- This proposition would create a substantial tax increase (roughly $12.5 billion per annum) on commercial and industrial property owners and would increase the rents paid by their tenants. These cost increases would eliminate jobs, suppress new business activity, and prompt firms to move out of state.
- A random sample of about 22,000 commercial property transactions in California’s major population centers from 2018 to 2020 found that two-thirds sold for less than $3 million. The median price was $1.6 million. Based on this sample, most properties in California be exempt from Prop. 15. In general, small businesses require less space and operate in relatively small and inexpensive properties.But many small businesses rent their places of business. Small-business renters could suffer if increased property tax bills are passed through to them.
- "Too many families have been priced out of their neighborhoods because of the rising cost of living. Prop. 15 will raise the cost of living for California families by up to $960 and will especially hurt lower–income communities." —Alice Huffman, President, California State Conference of the NAACP
